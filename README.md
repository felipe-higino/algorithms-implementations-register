# algorithms-implementations-register
✍️📚 This is a register of my programming studies, that includes:
* Some first contacts with programming languages
* Some Mathematical algorithms implementations

# Algorithms
* [Dijkstra in Prolog](https://github.com/fhps1/algorithms-implementations-register/tree/master/Prolog/prolog-solving-dijkstra-graph)

* [Truth Table in JS](https://github.com/fhps1/algorithms-implementations-register/tree/master/JavaScript/truth-table-solver)

# Tests and Learning
