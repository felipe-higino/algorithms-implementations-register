# Typescript, Jest + Observer Pattern
✍️📚 This program was made for studying purposes

## Context
- Work in progress...
- Just implementing graph algorithms in order to learn more about typescript 

## What i've learned
- Typescript can deal with both OOP and functional paradigm
- Functional paradigm has a more test-friendly syntax and workflow
- Typescript types are just a cool feature to create reusable data structures. It's a better aproach than class syntax, that encapsulate both data and behaviour.
