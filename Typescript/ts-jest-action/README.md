# Typescript, Jest + Observer Pattern
✍️📚 This program was made for studying purposes

## Context
- It's part of my Typescript studies, where i was discovering how to do unit tests and implement the observer pattern

## What i've learned
- In C#, we have delegates that can be used as a callback container that is called using .**Invoke()**. I tried to simulate this behaviour in **Action.ts** class
- Unit tests using Jest and ts-jest npm package
- tsc to transpile TS to JS and execute JS in Node

## How to use
- transpile using tsc
- execute one of npm scripts
  - test (run all jest tests)
  - run-index (run main script)
  - start-live-transpile (workflow helper)
