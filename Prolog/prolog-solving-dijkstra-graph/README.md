# Prolog implementation of Dijkstra's Minimum Path algorithm
‚úçÔ∏èüìö This program was made for studying purposes

## Context
* I was trying to figure out what is *"Logic Paradigm"* for the "Programing Languages" subject in college, and realized that i shoud learn *Prolog*

* At the same time, i was having the *"Graphs Theory"* subject in college too, so that's why i tryied to implement *Dijkstra's minimum path algorithm*.

## What i've learned
Prolog was a really new cool experience for me, where i've learned concepts like:
* *Pure functions* and deal with no side effects
* Diferences between *Imperative* and *Declarative* languages
* Logic and Functional paradigm
* Logic engine and Horn Clausules
* *Non-structured* programming
