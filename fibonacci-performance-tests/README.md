# Performance comparisons - recursive fibonacci
‚úçÔ∏èüìö This program was made for studying purposes

## Context
* I was just curious **how diferent languages deal with recursion algorithms**, so i just write some programs to test how much time costs them to finish the recursive iterations.

## Results
* The source code is avaiable in repository.
* Made 5 tests for each lang.
* fibo(40). (the 40'th number of fibonacci).

|            | Average time to finish algorithm |

|    Java    |             428,8 ms             |
|      C     |             578,8 ms             |
|     C++    |             633,4 ms             |

## What i've learned
* Basic of some languages syntaxes
* How to make time-complexity tests in some languages
