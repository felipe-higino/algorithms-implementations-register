# Truth table formula solver
‚úçÔ∏èüìö This program was made for studying purposes

## Context
* I was having the "Logic" subject in college, where i've learned about the "truth table" to determinate the possible values for a propositional formula.

* I was thinking about out how to implement an algorithm that solves any formula (just for curiosity) and there it is!

## What i've learned

* Node.Js Runtime
* Deal with JavaScript *arrow function* notation
* *Regular Expressions* to manipulate strings
* The diference and utility between *Infix/ Prefix/ Postfix* notations
